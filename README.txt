	Veterans Resource Center (VRC)  Project
---------------------------------------------------------------

Following is a Short Description of the Project:


The Veterans Resource Center (VRC) is looking for a simple program 
that will allow them to track student use of their services. 
They need a GUI-based program that records the number of people, 
the time, and their reason for visiting.

For example, if a student enters VRC center to use the microwave;
the program (monitoring program) would enter a reason from a numbered 
list, that would record the reason, the time, and add that person to 
an ongoing count.

This program should output the data into a text file whose contents 
can be easily copied & pasted into MS Excel for graphing, should be 
GUI/ Swing based.


A numbered list (reasons for visiting)
1. to discuss a personal matter
2. to use microwave
3. to use PC (for email)
4. to donate a book
